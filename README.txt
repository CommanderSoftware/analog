This is a copy of the original Analog code for producing HTML reports from web server statistics.
We have modified just a few lines so that it detects and reports on a couple of the more recent Windows versions.

We haven't updated it for a while.
Analog itself hasn't been updated for even longer.

The Readme for analog can be found in the file docs/Readme.html.
It was once at http://www.analog.cx/docs/Readme.html but this is now defunct.
Although it seems that, for now, http://www.web42.com/analog and, more specifically, http://www.web42.com/analog/docs/Readme.html is still available.
